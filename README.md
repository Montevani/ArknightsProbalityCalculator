### Arknights?
Arknights is a Chinese tower defense mobile game developed by Studio Montagne and Hypergryph and published by Yostar and Hypergryph. In the game players can use in-game currency to randomly obtain new characters (operators) through a gacha system, a game mechanic similar to slot machines. Characters are ranked by their rarity and strength, with 6* operators being the most rare and usually the most powerful.
